# Preserving Community Structure by Approximate Metric Backbone

## Experimental Results

Plots are available in `plots_publish` directory and can be reproduced with `old/plots.py`

## C++

`src/mb/` contains Metric Backbone interface, and algorithms for the MB calculation, both exact and approximate, and

`src/experiment` contains all the experiments, e.g. time comparison for methods

## Python

Python is used for community detection quality evaluation and plots. The code is available in `old/` and main files are `old/approx.py` and `old/plots.py`.
